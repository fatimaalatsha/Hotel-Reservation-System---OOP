3. **Book Room:**
   - Customers can book available rooms with different numbers and types of beds.

4. **Update Data:**
   - Customers can modify their personal information such as names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and ages.

5. **Delete Account:**
   - Customers can delete their accounts, and all related data will be removed.

6. **Cancel Booking:**
   - Customers can cancel bookings, and the canceled room will be returned to available rooms.

7. **Admin Registration & Login:**
   - Admins manage the system, performing CRUD operations and managing flights and customers.

8. **CRUD Operations:**
